### XSecurity (Checkers)

A security plugin in Xcode with clang analyzer's checkers for iOS application development. 
This plugin aims to reduce the vulnerability made during development by detecting the vulnerability 
as it is being created. 

This readme file is mainly for the Checkers for details about the plugin please see the readme file 
under the main folder.


##### PREPARATION
_____________________________

We included a binary of clang with these checkers pre-built in it but currently there are problems executing it
from Xcode. So we recomment that you build your own copy of clang with these checkers included.
We believe that it is better for you to build the original clang first. Then, include the checkers from this 
repository and build clang again. In this way you can tell whether your setup is working in the first
place or not.


We plan to automate things for you but for the meantime please bear with us by following this procedure.

   
    Get the required tools.
      - See Getting Started with the LLVM System - Requirements.
      - Note that Python is needed for running the test suite. Get it at: http://www.python.org/download
   
    Checkout LLVM:
      - Change directory to where you want the llvm directory placed.
      - svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm 
        (Currently we are using the revision 200605. You should check it out with 
        -r option like svn co -r 200605 http://xxxx.)
   
    Checkout Clang:
      - cd llvm/tools
      - svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang 
        (Use same option mentioned above)
      - cd ../..
   
    Checkout extra Clang Tools: (optional)
      - cd llvm/tools/clang/tools
      - svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/clang-tools-extra/trunk extra 
        (Use same option mentioned above)
      - cd ../../../..
   
    Checkout Compiler-RT:
      - cd llvm/projects
      - svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk compiler-rt 
        (Use same option mentioned above)
      - cd ../..
   
    Build LLVM and Clang:
      - mkdir build  
        (for building without polluting the source dir)
      - cd build
      - ../llvm/configure --enable-optimized --disable-compiler-version-checks

        (configure build folder which is outside the source dir)
        Note: At this point if you are able to successfully execute the above mentioned 
              command then you might want to have a coffee break or do something else 
              after executing the following make, since it will take a little while to complete.
      - make
   
    By now you may have the following folder structure:
      ____XSecurity
       |____checker (checker folder)
       | |____build
       | | |____Release+Asserts
       | | | |____bin
       | | |____scripts
       | |
       | |____llvm
       | | |____tools
       | | | |____clang
       | | | | |____lib
       | | | | | |____StaticAnalyzer
       | | | | | | |____Checkers
       | | | | |
       | | | | |____tools
       | | | | | |____scan-build
       | |  
       | |____test
       | 
       |____plugin
       | |____XSecurity
       | | |____XSecurity
   
   
      ____some_folder (llvm working folder)
       |____build
       | |____Release+Asserts
       | | |____bin
       | |____scripts
       |
       |____llvm
       | |____tools
       | | |____clang
       | | | |____lib
       | | | | |____StaticAnalyzer
       | | | | | |____Checkers
       | | | |
       | | | |____tools
       | | | | |____scan-build
   
    NOTE:
    - Before moving the files, please take note of Checkers.td in llvm/tools/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/Checkers,
    be careful not to directly overwrite it, you may have the latest llvm source code and
    they may have addded more checkers compared to the checkers we have when we created our checkers.
    - It is highly advised that you compare the two versions of Checkers.td and add only the portion applicable to
      MSecIOSAppSec.

    - Move the the files under checker folder to the root folder of your llvm working folder.
    - Build clang (make) in build folder (some_folder/build)
    - To confirm if the iOSAppSec checkers were built successfully execute the following under the same build folder.
      ./scripts/confirm_checker.sh iOS
   
      It will show you the list of the iOSAppSec checkers (there are 10 at the time of this writing)

  
##### INSTALLATION
_____________________________

You should do the following after succesfully building clang, under llvm working folder's build folder 
(the one with files in this repository) 
 - Quit Xcode if it is running.
 - cd [some_folder]/build/
 - execute ./scripts/apply_new_clang.sh 


##### EXECUTION in Xcode
_____________________________

 Open Xcode and find "XSecurity" in the main menu, typically before the Help item.

 If you can't find the XSecurity menu then the plug-in was not loaded successfully. 
 Under "XSecurity", you can find the last menu item, "Static Security Analyzer". Under it select "Analyze".
